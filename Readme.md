# Car Insurance API

This is a simple Express.js application that provides APIs for calculating car value, risk rating based on claim history, and insurance premium quotes.

## Setup

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd car-insurance-api
   ```

4. Install project dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

By default, the server runs on port 5000, but you can modify the `port` variable in `server.js` to change it.
